# What is a Set?

A set is a **well-defined** collection of **distinct** objects, considered as an object in its own right.

- **Well-defined** means: for any object, you can clearly say "is it in the set" or "is it not"?
- **Distinct** means: no duplicates - an element or object is either in or not, never repeated.

# Real World Example of a Set
- The players in a soccer team.
- The students in an institution.
- Fruits in a basket.
- The cups in a kitchen.

Another real world anology includes **a library's collection of books:**
- The library(set) contains unique books(elements).
- You can ask if a particular book is in the library.
- You don't count the same book twice in your collection.
- The library can be described by rules, e.g "all books published after 2000"
