# What is a Set?

A set is a well-defined collection of distinct objects, considered as an object in its own right.

- *Well-defined* means: for any object, you can clearly say "is it in the set" or "is it not"?
- Distinct means: no duplicates - an element or object is either in or not, never repeated.
