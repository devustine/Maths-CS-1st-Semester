# What is a Set?

A set is a **well-defined** collection of **distinct** objects, considered as an object in its own right.

- **Well-defined** means: for any object, you can clearly say "is it in the set" or "is it not"?
- **Distinct** means: no duplicates - an element or object is either in or not, never repeated.

# Real World Example of a Set
- A player(element or object) in a soccer team(set).
- A student(element or object) in an institution(set).
- A Fruit(element or object) in a basket(set).
- A cup(element or object) in a kitchen(set).

Another real world anology includes **a library's collection of books:**
- The library(set) contains unique books(elements).
- You can ask if a particular book is in the library.
- You don't count the same book twice in your collection.
- The library can be described by rules, e.g "all books published after 2000"

Sets can be represented by capital letters such as A,B,C,D. While the elements of a set can be represented by their **names** or **small letters** such as a,b,c, or x,y,z e.t.c. It helps visually distinguish the set from its elements.

Why is it represented like this?
Let’s define a simple set:
A = {a, b, c}
- A is the name of the set.
- a, b, c are the elements of that set.

As you can see it helps keeps things clear and standardized. It is not a strict rule it's just a notation. Just like how we name variables in programming languages like python using camelCase or snake_case.

# Three Types of Ways to Describe a Set

## 1. Roster Notation (explicit) or enumeration Method: 
In this method, we list all the elements in the set. To write or specify a set in the roster notation method, The names or symbols representing the elements or objects in the set is written in a line and seperated by comma and enclosed in braces. E.g set A={1,2,3,4}.

### When is the Roster notation method used?
- It is used when the set is finite. In other words, when the number of elements in the set is not much.
- Every element is written explicitly. This means when listing elements in a set using the roster notation method, you will have to list out all the elements one by one. For example if the elements of a set is **1,2,3,4**. You do not list it as **A = {some small numbers}**, it should be listed this way **A = 1,2,3,4**
- The order of the set does not matter, but duplicates are not allowed. For example set A = {1,2,3} is the same as Set B = {3,2,1} so the order or the way the elements are arranged, does not matter. Also, duplicates are not allowed for example sets like this set A = {1,1,2,3}. This is not allowed because 1 was written twice.
- For sets with many elements especially those following an implicit pattern, the list of members can be abbreviated using an ellipsis. For example set S={1,2,3,4,…,100}. since we’re listing elements explicitly in roster notation, writing all 100 values would be tedious. so we use ellipsis(...) to compress the set. It is used when you you want to quickly give a sense of the range of numbers showing where it starts and ends.
